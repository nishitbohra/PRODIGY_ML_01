ðŸ“Œ Task Highlights:

# Problem Statement: 
Design a model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more.

# Approach: 
I dove deep into the world of regression analysis, exploring data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training techniques. Leveraging Python and libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, I crafted a robust pipeline for this task.

# Data Wrangling: 
Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing features were crucial steps in ensuring the model's accuracy and reliability.

# Feature Engineering:
I meticulously engineered features to capture the essence of each property, allowing the model to make informed predictions.

# Model Training:
Implementing Linear Regression, I fine-tuned hyperparameters, validated the model using cross-validation techniques, and achieved an impressive level of accuracy.

# Results:
My hard work paid off! The model demonstrated a strong ability to predict house prices, with an RMSE that showcased its efficiency and effectiveness.
# Learnings:
This task pushed me to think critically, problem-solve, and work meticulously with data. It also provided me with a deeper understanding of regression algorithms and their applications.
